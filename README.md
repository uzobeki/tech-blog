## Thoughts :thinking:
This was pretty difficult for me. I had a hard time figuring if something was wrong with my code. I kept running into the "Wrong Route" error, but I eventually figured it out. Thank goodness for video references, but I feel that I should've been able to figure it out without them.

## Technologies Used
Languages: Node.js

Packages: express, mysql2, sequelize
